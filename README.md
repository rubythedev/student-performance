## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify key factors that contribute to students' academic success. By analyzing both categorical and continuous variables, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different factors correlate with exam scores and improvement rates.

### Key Questions Explored:
- How do attendance and study hours correlate with higher exam scores?
- What impact do parental involvement and family income have on student performance?
- How do resources like internet access and tutoring sessions influence exam outcomes?
- What conditions and habits are optimal for achieving high scores?
